KSmoothDock is a cool desktop panel with parabolic zooming effect for KDE Plasma  5. While visually it is inspired by Mac OS X's Dock, it aims to follow the traditional Linux model of desktop panel with the application menu, launchers, the pager, the taskbar and the system tray. Currently KSmoothDock only supports the application menu, launchers and the pager, and is meant to use in conjunction with a Plasma 5 panel that provides the taskbar and the system tray.

KSmoothDock is written in C++ and depends on Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5.
